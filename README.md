## 🚀 Getting Started with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### 📌 ESLint Setup

If you're developing a production app, consider using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. You can explore the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).
