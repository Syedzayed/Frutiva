# Frutiva
Frutivá is a fictional fermented juice brand crafted as a design-forward frontend project. This responsive website includes a high-end landing page with animated interactions, scroll-based visuals, and a clean, minimalist UI. It’s built using React, Framer Motion, and vanilla CSS, with scalable structure to extend into a full company site.
